# Hospital-Appointment-System-using-DSA
🏥 Hospital Appointment Scheduling System (C++ Console Project)

This is a C++ console application that simulates a real-world hospital appointment system. It allows patients to book time slots, prioritizes emergency cases, maintains logs, and provides multiple utility features to assist hospital staff.

📌 Features

➕ Add new patient appointments

🚑 Process emergency patients based on severity

❌ Cancel appointments using patient ID

🔍 Search appointment details by patient ID

📋 View all appointments slot-wise

👴 View patients above a certain age

📝 Log all activities into a log.txt file automatically

⚙️ Technologies Used

💻 Language: C++

🧠 Concepts: Structures, Classes, Linked Lists, Unordered Maps, Priority Queues, File Handling

🛠️ Tools: VS Code / Code::Blocks, MinGW Compiler

🧱 Data Structures Used

🔗 Linked List – Stores patients in each time slot

🗺️ Unordered Map – Maps time slots to appointment lists

🧮 Priority Queue – Maintains emergency patients sorted by severity

🧾 File Handling – Logs all operations to log.txt

🆔 ID Map (unordered_map) – Enables fast lookup for search and cancellation
